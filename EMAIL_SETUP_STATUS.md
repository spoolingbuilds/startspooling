# Email Setup Status

## ⚠️ Current Issue

The Resend API key is in **TEST MODE** which has the following limitations:

### Test Mode Limitations
1. **Limited Recipients**: Can only send emails to registered team email addresses
2. **Team Email**: `team@startspooling.com` is the registered team email
3. **Cannot Send to**: External email addresses like `virtuapete@gmail.com` or `virtualpete@gmail.com`

### Error Message
```
"You can only send testing emails to your own email address (team@startspooling.com). 
To send emails to other recipients, please verify a domain at resend.com/domains, 
and change the `from` address to an email using this domain."
```

## ✅ What's Working

- ✅ Email service is properly configured
- ✅ Database tables exist
- ✅ API endpoints are working
- ✅ Can send emails to `team@startspooling.com`

## 🔧 Solution Options

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain (Recommended for Production)

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `startspooling.com`)
3. Add DNS records as instructed by Resend
4. Wait for verification (usually 1-24 hours)
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   FROM_EMAIL="noreply@startspooling.com"
   ```
6. Restart the dev server

**Benefits:**
- Can send to any email address
- Better deliverability
- Professional email address
- Production-ready

### Option 2: Use a Different Email Service

For development, you could use services that don't require domain verification:

- **SendGrid**: 100 emails/day free
- **Mailgun**: 5,000 emails/month free
- **AWS SES**: Pay-as-you-go, very cheap
- **Mailtrap** (testing only): Catches all emails for testing

### Option 3: Test with Team Email

For now, use `team@startspooling.com` as your test email to verify the system works.

## 🧪 Testing Right Now

To test the complete flow with the current setup:

1. **Submit Email**: Use `team@startspooling.com` on the landing page
2. **Check Email**: Look for the verification code in `team@startspooling.com` inbox
3. **Enter Code**: Use the verification page to enter the code
4. **Verify Success**: Complete the verification flow

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test with `team@startspooling.com` to verify the system works
2. **Short-term**: Set up domain verification in Resend
3. **Production**: Use verified domain for all emails

## 📧 Current Configuration

```env
RESEND_API_KEY="re_D4sUUb5X_HbfHkHMkwoGw6V22ioZdGfzY"
FROM_EMAIL="onboarding@resend.dev"
```

**Note**: The `onboarding@resend.dev` address is Resend's test domain, which only works with registered team emails.
